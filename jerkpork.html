            <p> <b>Jerk Pork</b> is a traditional Jamaican dish known for its rich, smoky, and spicy flavors. 
                It involves marinating pork, typically shoulder or loin, in a flavorful blend of spices and seasonings. 
                The key ingredient is jerk seasoning, which includes allspice (pimento), Scotch bonnet peppers, thyme, garlic, ginger, and scallions. 
                The pork is often marinated overnight to allow the flavors to penetrate deeply into the meat.

                 <p>After marinating, the pork is traditionally slow-cooked over pimento wood,
                     which imparts a distinct smoky flavor.
                      This cooking method can be done on a grill or in a smoker, but oven-baking can also be an alternative for those without access to outdoor cooking equipment. 
                      The result is a tender, juicy pork with a well-balanced heat and aromatic spice blend. Jerk pork is typically served with sides such as rice and peas, 
                      festival (a type of sweet fried bread), or roasted breadfruit, 
                      making it a hearty and satisfying dish that showcases the vibrant culinary heritage of Jamaica.
