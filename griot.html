        <p><b>Griot</b> is a popular Haitian dish made from marinated and fried pork shoulder. It is typically served with rice, beans, and pikliz (spicy pickled vegetables). The marinating process infuses the pork with a blend of citrus and spices, resulting in a flavorful and tender meat.</p>
        <p>After marinating, the pork is fried until crispy on the outside while remaining juicy on the inside. Griot is often enjoyed at celebrations and gatherings, showcasing the rich culinary traditions of Haiti.</p>
